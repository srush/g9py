This is a shameless copy of [g9.js](https://github.com/bijection/g9), written in Python. This prototype shows off some of the cool things you can do with Pyodide for running Python demos in the browser.

## What is this? 

* You now can run [Python in the browser](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html).
* This lets us run MiniTorch (a pure Python torchlike with a numpy backend) in the browser. 
* With Python autodifferentiation in the browser, its easy to build mathy toys.
